#Data Pipelines

Goal: create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

# Explanation of files in the repository

* **[airflow](airflow)**: workspace folder storing the airflow DAGs and plugins used by the airflow server.
* **[airflow/dags/s3_to_redshift_dag.py](airflow/dags/s3_to_redshift_dag.py)**: "Main"-DAG written in Python containing all steps of the pipeline.
* **[airflow/plugins/operators/](airflow/plugins/operators)**: Folder containing such called operators which can be called inside an Airflow DAG. These are python classes to outsource and build generic functions as modules of the DAG.

# The database schema design and ETL pipeline.

In order to enable Sparkify to analyze their data, a Relational Database Schema was created, which can be filled with an ETL pipeline.

The so-called star scheme enables the company to view the user behaviour over several dimensions.
The fact table is used to store all user song activities that contain the category "NextSong". Using this table, the company can relate and analyze the dimensions users, songs, artists and time.

* **Fact Table**: songplays
* **Dimension Tables**: users, songs, artists and time.

# Dataset used

The data is queried from s3 buckets hosted at AWS

* **Song data**: ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data```
* **Log data**: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.
