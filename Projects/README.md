# Project [1](https://github.com/devathrajharish/udacity-dataengineer-nanodegree/tree/master/Projects/P1-Data%20Modeling%20with%20PostgreSQL) and [2](https://github.com/devathrajharish/udacity-dataengineer-nanodegree/tree/master/Projects/P2-Data%20Modeling%20with%20Apache%20Cassandra) – Data Modeling
- learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. In the project, students will build SQL (Postgres) and NoSQL (Apache Cassandra) data models using user activity data for a music streaming app.

# [Project 3 – Cloud Data Warehouses](https://github.com/devathrajharish/udacity-dataengineer-nanodegree/tree/master/Projects/P3-Data%20Warehouse)
- learn to create cloud-based data warehouses. In the project, students will build an ELT pipeline that extracts data from Amazon S3, stages it in Amazon Redshift, and transforms it into a set of dimensional tables.

# [Project 4 – Data Lakes with Apache Spark](https://github.com/devathrajharish/udacity-dataengineer-nanodegree/tree/master/Projects/P4-Data%20Lake%20with%20Spark)
- learn more about the big data ecosystem, how to work with massive datasets with Apache Spark, and how to store big data in a data lake. In the project, students will build an ETL pipeline for a data lake using Apache Spark and S3.

# [Project 5 – Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow](https://github.com/devathrajharish/udacity-dataengineer-nanodegree/tree/master/Projects/P5-%20Airflow)
- learn to schedule, automate, and monitor data pipelines using Apache Airflow. In the project, they’ll continue your work on the music streaming company’s data infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines.

# [Capstone Project](https://github.com/devathrajharish/udacity-dataengineer-nanodegree/tree/master/Projects/Capstorne%20Project)
- In the capstone project, gather data from several different data sources; transform, combine, and summarize it; and create a clean database for others to analyze.
